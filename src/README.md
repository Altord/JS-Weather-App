# Weather App React

A simple weather app that allows you to search for a city in the world and have it return the weather conditions in metric units.

Future possible updates:
* Buttons that switch between metric and imperial units
* Api that fetches vector free images based on weather or goes through a list that fetches saved images eg. cloudy = 1, weatherList = [0,cloudy imported from external png,2,3] etc.
* Multi day forecast, maps for the region etc.

This can be improved in many ways and I plan to do so
